# KWH-Consumption-Prediction-Using-Temporal-Fusion-Transformer-TFT-
This project aims to predict energy consumption (measured in kWh) over time using a Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model. The model leverages time-series data to provide accurate and interpretable predictions of future energy usage, which can aid in optimizing energy resources.
